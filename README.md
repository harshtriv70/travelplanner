## ⚡ Problems I Faced  
While building and hosting this project using IBM Cloud and Granite LLM API, I encountered a few challenges:  

1. **CIH (Capacity Instance Hours) Limitation**  
   - IBM Cloud free account provides limited CIH (usage hours).  
   - Once the quota was exhausted, the deployed AI services stopped responding.  
   - This made continuous testing and long-term usage difficult.  

2. **API Integration & Response Issues**  
   - At times, the API requests did not return responses due to free-tier restrictions.  
   - I had to implement error handling to manage failed responses gracefully.  
   - It required optimizing calls and testing under limited usage conditions.  

3. **Free Account Constraints**  
   - Certain advanced features and higher scalability were locked behind paid plans.  
   - I worked within these limits and focused on building a functional prototype.
